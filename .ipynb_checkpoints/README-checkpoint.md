# Aviation Accident Data Analysis

## 1. Introduction

This project analyzes historical aviation accident data to help guide a company in making informed decisions about purchasing aircraft. The focus is on identifying trends in aircraft makes and models involved in accidents, especially fatal ones, to assess the relative safety and reliability of different aircraft types.

## 2. Dataset

- **Source**: [National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB)] or other
- **Records**: ~90,000+ aviation incident reports
- **Features**: Accident date, location, aircraft make/model, engine type, number of injuries, weather condition, flight phase, etc.
- **Time range**: 1940sâ€“present (depending on availability)

### Data Cleaning

- Dropped columns with over 60% missing values (e.g., Latitude, Longitude, Schedule, Air Carrier)
- Filled missing injury data with `0`
- Converted dates to datetime format
- Standardized column names to lowercase with underscores

## 4. Tools & Technologies

- **Python**
- **Pandas**
- **NumPy**
- **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**
- **Jupyter Notebook**

## 5. Setup Instructions

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/aviation-safety-analysis.git
cd aviation-safety-analysis
pip install -r requirements.txt
````

Or open the notebooks directly using Jupyter:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

## 6. Key Insights

* Certain aircraft makes (e.g., Cessna, Piper) have high accident frequencies â€” partly due to high usage.
* Some models have disproportionately high fatality rates.
* Weather conditions and flight phases (especially "approach" and "takeoff") significantly impact accident severity.
* Aircraft with more engines generally show lower fatality averages per incident.

## 7. Visualizations

* Trend of Injuries Over Time â€“ Measures safety improvements
* Fatal Injuries by Purpose â€“ Exposes high-risk flight type
* Injuries by Weather â€“ Identifies weather-based patterns
* 
Safest Aircraft Models â€“ Suggests models withthe  highestuninjuredj
* Total Accidents by Aircraft â€“ Highlights risky modelsur"C:\Users\Administrator\Documents\tabvis pic.png"e.png)

## 8. Future Work

* Normalize accidents by aircraft usage (if flight-hour data is available)
* Include aircraft age and maintenance data
* Build a machine learning model to predict severity based on flight conditions

## 9. Credits

* Data from the [NTSB Accident Database](https://www.ntsb.gov/)
* Projeccindy akinyir Name
